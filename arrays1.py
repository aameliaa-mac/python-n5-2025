# program 1 - predict and read lesson 309 (24/03/25)

# what is an array?
# if we know that we need to store more than one occurrence of the same variable we use an array!
# an array lets us create lots of versions of a variable and stores them as a list!!

# you should call it a 1D array, but just array is fine as we havent learned 2D or 3D (2D - AH and 3D - uni)
# if you see the word 'data structure' the answer is usually a 1D array
# works for all data types (string, real, boolean etc)

name = [ 'alice' , 'bob' , 'carol' , 'david' ]

name.append['edna'] # append means add on

print (name[2]) # remember to use square brackets! []

# the name carol is shown, as it is name2. alice = name0, bob = name1, carol = name2 and david = name3
# it always starts with 0, not 1

# if we add the name 'edna' we would call it name[4] if we wanted to print it 

# i talked a bit more about arrays in the rest of the array lessons (lesson 309) and also in 5_outline.py
