#just some simple python notes!
# this a comment - just text, it is ignored!

# this a simple command - print. you must use brackets and quotation marks!
# you can put words on multiple lines very easily!
print("hello")
print("there")
print("...")

# this is called user input using variables!
your_name = input("what is your name? :) ")

# you can then use the variable in a print. you don't have to use a comma ( , ) you can also use a plus ( + )!
print("hello there", your_name, "!!!")
