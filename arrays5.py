# traversing a 1D array - lesson 318 (23/06/25)

# Create a program that contains an array of 5 dog food weights (in grams) between 0 and 300g. 
# Traverse the 1D array to calculate and display the total amount of food given to the dog over 5 days.

weights = [200,210,190,230,235]

amount = sum(weights)

print(weights)
print("total amount of food given (grams): ", amount)
